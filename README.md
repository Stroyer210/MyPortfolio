## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

Creating this project was really important for me because it allowed me to apply and consolidate the web design skills I've been honing over the past few months. One of my primary motivations for creating this project was to develop a polished portfolio to showcase when applying for jobs. 

I dedicated a good amount of time and effort to ensure that my portfolio not only looks appealing but also effectively represents my skills and achievements. Within the portfolio, I've highlighted various projects that I made during my bootcamp, offering a comprehensive view of my work. One of the most important aspects of this project was mastering the integration of React and Tailwind CSS. This combination allowed me to create a dynamic and visually appealing website. Additionally, I successfully deployed my portfolio to Netlify which helped me to expand my knowledge of deployment techniques.

## Usage :bar_chart:
If you are unable to open the URL, I attached a screenshot of it below, so you have an idea of how it looks like:
    ![the main page.](public/screen1.png)

    ![The about page.](public/screen2.png)
    ---
    
As you can see, there is a little menu on the top-right of the website, so you can click any of them and it will take you to the respective section. You can read a little bit about me under the "About" section. If you go to my work, you can click on some of the projects I have done and it will take you to either the deployed application or to my GitHub, you can also download my resume on the main page or in the "Resume" section. In adittion to that, you can contact me and I will reach out to you!
